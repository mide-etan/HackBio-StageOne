**Best Practices in Single-Cell RNA-seq Analysis: A Tutorial**

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has fundamentally advanced the study of biological systems, enabling the analysis of gene expression at an unprecedented resolution and leading to the discovery of previously obscured cellular populations (Luecken & Theis, 2019). The immense potential of this technology has driven rapid development, resulting in over 385 available analytical tools as of early 2019 (Luecken & Theis, 2019). However, the relative immaturity of the field and this proliferation of methods present significant challenges to establishing standardized scRNA-seq analysis workflows (Luecken & Theis, 2019). To address this, current best practices outline a comprehensive workflow that progresses from raw count matrices through downstream analysis, providing a critical foundation for standardization efforts (Luecken & Theis, 2019).

The initial stage, pre-processing, involves several steps: quality control (QC), normalization, data correction, feature selection, and dimensionality reduction (Luecken & Theis, 2019). Cell QC is crucial, requiring the joint examination of key covariates-such as count depth, number of detected genes, and mitochondrial read fraction-to identify and filter out outliers like dying cells or doublets (Luecken & Theis, 2019). For normalization, which aims to correct for variability in captured mRNA molecules due to sampling effects, the scran pooling-based size factor estimation method is highly recommended for non-full-length datasets, consistently demonstrating top performance in comparison studies (Luecken & Theis, 2019). Subsequently, data correction addresses unwanted variability; for straightforward batch effects within a single experiment, the linear method ComBat is recommended as a strong performer (Luecken & Theis, 2019). A critical recommendation is to perform statistical testing (like differential expression) on "measured data" (raw or globally scaled/normalized data) rather than on "corrected data," which is better reserved for visual comparison (Luecken & Theis, 2019).

For efficiency in downstream analysis, dimensionality reduction is performed (Luecken & Theis, 2019). This often starts with feature selection to identify highly variable genes (HVGs), typically selecting between 1,000 and 5,000 informative genes (Luecken & Theis, 2019). For visualization, non-linear methods are preferred; UMAP (Uniform Approximation and Projection) is regarded as best practice for exploratory data visualization due to its speed and ability to scale to large datasets (Luecken & Theis, 2019).

Downstream analysis focuses on biological inference through cell-level and gene-level approaches (Luecken & Theis, 2019). Cell clustering, often achieved using Louvain community detection on a K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) graph, has been shown to be robust for scRNA-seq data (Luecken & Theis, 2019). Trajectory inference (TI) models continuous biological processes; the Slingshot method is highly effective for reconstructing simpler linear or bifurcating trajectories (Luecken & Theis, 2019). Finally, differential expression (DE) testing is performed, typically within cell-identity clusters. Recommended tools include the single-cell specific hurdle model MAST or bulk methods adapted for single-cell data, such as limma-voom (Luecken & Theis, 2019).
