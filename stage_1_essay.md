Dashboards for Biology: Stop treating your plots like PowerPoint
In the biological sciences, the traditional standard of data presentation has long relied on static figures, often described as the "PowerPoint" approach. This method, characterized by fixed line graphs and summary tables, is increasingly viewed as insufficient for better presentation of results, particularly in basic science studies with small sample sizes. A lot of research indicates that traditional line graphs often conceal vital information, such as group overlap and individual response patterns. Because many different data distributions can produce identical summary statistics, static plots can be fundamentally misleading.
To modernize this workflow, researchers are transitioning toward actionable science through interactive R-based frameworks like Shiny and Quarto. Shiny is an R package that allows for the creation of web applications by exposing R scripts through a browser interface. Unlike traditional linear scripts, Shiny utilizes reactive programming, which employs an interconnected structure of User Interface and Server components. When a user modifies an input, such as a sample size or a specific gene filter, the server executes only the minimal code required to update the output in real-time. This interactivity transforms scientific publications from static reports into interactive datasets that reveal vital information in scientific research.
The practical application of these tools bridges the "research-management divide". For instance, in clinical research, interactive dashboards allow for the real-time exploration of trial outcomes, ensuring that medical professionals have immediate access to the latest data to inform decision-making. In high-dimensional research like single-cell RNA sequencing, the rcellana package (available via Bioconductor) makes it easy to share data with an entire lab so that all members can search and explore results independently. This tool modifies access by allowing users to pull information from a central database without needing the original programmer's help for every new query.
Furthermore, the shift from "PowerPoint" entails moving away from the constraints of the 16:9 slide frame. Emerging Quarto extensions, such as those utilizing Typst or close read, allow for the creation of large-format posters and "infinite canvases". These formats support "scrollytelling" and predetermined sequences of pans and zooms, allowing a viewer to traverse a massive canvas of content at various scales.
Ultimately, treating plots as interactive tools rather than static ornaments enhances transparency and reproducibility. While tools like the ReporteRs package can automate the generation of PowerPoint slides from R, the true paradigm shift occurs when interactivity becomes the primary medium for data evaluation. By allowing readers to view individual-level data and change scores for any two conditions, interactive graphics provide the crucial information necessary to interpret longitudinal data and identify distinct "responders" and "nonresponders" within a dataset.
